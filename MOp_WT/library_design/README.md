- Python scritps for MERFISH library design.


- Library design of DNA-MERFISH requires ImageAnalysis3 [https://github.com/zhengpuas47/ImageAnalysis3] or the archived tools [https://github.com/ZhuangLab/Chromatin_Analysis_2020_cell/tree/master/sequential_tracing/source] using the scripts describled in the folder.

 - **ctp11_genome** includes scripts to design probes for targeting the mouse genome in the evenly spaced manner (~ 2Mb).

 - **ctp12_marker** includes scripts to design probes for TSSs of 28 marker genes.

 - **ctp13_superenhancer** includes scripts to design probes for targeting cell-type-specific super-enhancers.


- **rna_mop** includes scritps to generate adaptor probes for RNA-MERFISH imaging [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03705-x].

- **generate_sequence_table** includes scritps to generate probe in a table (.csv) format for preparing supplementary information.
