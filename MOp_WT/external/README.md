- Python scritps and files to process external datasets:


 - **scritps** includes scripts to process external datasets.

 - **data** includes output generated from using scripts.

 - **resources** includes external or intermediate input to be used by scripts

- Note that **data** and **resources** only includes small files for demonstration purposes. They are copied from the paths locally generated using the scripts with all the required input files and correctly defined paths.
