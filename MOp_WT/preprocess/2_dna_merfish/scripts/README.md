- Decoding and preprocessing DNA-MERFISH involves two major steps below, where scripts are included in the following folders:


    - **1_spot_preprocess** includes scripts to preprocess and decode DNA-MERFISH data to candidate spots.

      - Implementation of scripts requires [ImageAnalysis3](https://github.com/zhengpuas47/ImageAnalysis3) or the Zhuang lab archived [source_tools](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/Chromatin_Analysis_2020_cell/tree/master/sequential_tracing/source)



    - **2_spot_pick** includes scripts to pick candidate spots for chromatin fibers.

      - Implementation of scripts requires [jie_modified](https://github.com/cosmosyw/jie/tree/0f797efcc52c1e9822a3cd03d8980cba9315b468)
